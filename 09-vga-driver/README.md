# VAG Driver
In this section we will do something which is a little bit more rewarding. We will
implement a _VGA display driver_ so that we can easily print to the screen.


## Add `vga_print`
Having to print each character separately is very tedious. Hence, we add another function
to the driver which allows us to print a whole message.

## Implement `vga_new_line`.
